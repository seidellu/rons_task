# rons_task

A short and dirty implementation of a two methods to solve rons task.

This implements a greedy and a random approach to solve the demanding list.

Since you do not handed me the demanding list i dont know if these programm parts match to your condition. Maybe you have to use my version, i just copied it from the screenshot, or adjust the function "generate_links_from_txt"

Have fun and feel free to ask if something is not clear:*

    git clone https://github.com/seidellu/rons_task.git
    cd rons_task
	pip install -r requirements.txt

It's highly recommended to use a virtual python environment.
